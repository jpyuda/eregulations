<p> 
    eRegulations is a web-based application that makes regulations easy to
    find, read and understand. It is continually being developed by the <a
    href="http://consumerfinance.gov">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</a>,
    and is a public domain work of the United States Government. 
</p>


<h3> Features </h3>

<p> Some of the main features of the tool are: </p>

<ul>

    <li> 
    <strong> Inline Interpretations. </strong>  Many regulation paragraphs have official
    interpretations that have traditionally been displayed at the end of the
    regulation, forcing readers to swap back and forth between the regulation
    content and interpretation at the end. eRegulations parses the
    intpretations for each paragraph, and displays them right under the
    paragraph/section being interpreted. 
    </li>

    <li> 
    <strong>Definitions.</strong> We highlight words that have been defined in the regulation,
    and the user can click on the word and see it's definition without
    scrolling to the part of the regulation that defines that word.
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Bookmarks</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Internal and external citations</strong> The parser parses out
        all internal and external citations in the regulation, and we display
        all citations as clickable links allowing easy navigation with a
        regulation, and externally to the relevant statutes, acts and other
        relevant material. 
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Search</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Alternate versions of the regulations</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Section-by-section analysis</strong>
    </li>

</ul>

<h3> Architecture </h3>

<p>
    There are three parts to the eRegulations application: a parser that
    converts regulation text into data (<a
    href="http://github.com/CFPB/regulations-parser">regulations-parser</a>),
    an API that hosts this data (<a
    href="http://github.com/eregs/regulations-core">regulations-core</a>), and
    the actual application itself which uses the data from the API to construct
    beautiful and usable regulations (<a 
    href="http://github.com/eregs/regulations-site">regulations-site</a>).

<p> regulations-parser is written in Python. </p>

<p> regulations-core is a MySQL backed Django application. </p>

<p>
The regulations-site front-end is a Backbone.js application nested within AMD
modules using Require.js. We also use a Grunt-based build system with Jasmine
for unit testing. On the back-end regulations-site is a Django application.
